# TPMM
TPMM is designed to identify invertons from metagenomic data in the same environment, especially the low-depth ones, based on the raw results of PhaseFinder. It helps define a high-confidence inverton set and is able to detect more invertons when the depth of reads is low. 
# Prepare the environment
Here, we recommend to prepare two seperate environments, one for preprocessing data using PhaseFinder, one for TPMM.
* To install  PhaseFinder, please refer to [PhaseFinder](https://github.com/XiaofangJ/PhaseFinder)
